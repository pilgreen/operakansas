Mr. Twister and the Tale of Tornado Alley, a brand new opera composed by Marc Hoffeditz, tells the tale of a family reunion between the North Wind and the South Wind as observed by a meteorologist and storm chaser, Mr. Twister, and his nephew. The story weaves together the science behind the formation of tornadoes and instruction on severe weather safety. Told via colorful characters, memorable melody, and approachable meteorological facts, this tale will appeal to a wide audience and maybe save a life or two. Opera Kansas is the winner of a Mid-America Arts Alliance Innovations Grant to bring the world premiere of this opera to the greater Wichita community. Opera Kansas is excited to partner with Exploration Place to bring to life this interactive and multi-sensory learning experience.

World Premiere March 17, 2022

11:00 AM and 1:00 PM

# Mr. Brewster's Invigorating Invention

The winner of the 2018 Zepick Modern Opera Competition, _Mr. Brewsterâ€™s Invigorating Invention_ is about the history and science of the kaleidoscope. This 35 minute opera in English has a STEAM theme (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) and is appropriate for individual classroom presentations in the studies of math, science, history, art and music and is also conducive to large assembly presentations.

Sir David Brewster was a Scottish physicist who invented the kaleidoscope in 1816. Soon millions of kaleidoscopes were in homes across the world. He has been called, " the father of modern experimental optics." This production uses creative digital media in bringing the science and colors of the kaleidoscope to life. It is designed to be appropriate for K-8 but is promoted by the composer as an opera for "children young, and old."
