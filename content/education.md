The winner of the 2018 Zepick Modern Opera Competition, _Mr. Brewsterâ€™s Invigorating Invention_ is about the history and science of the kaleidoscope. This 35 minute opera in English has a STEAM theme (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) and is appropriate for individual classroom presentations in the studies of math, science, history, art and music and is also conducive to large assembly presentations.

Sir David Brewster was a Scottish physicist who invented the kaleidoscope in 1816. Soon millions of kaleidoscopes were in homes across the world. He has been called, " the father of modern experimental optics." This production uses creative digital media in bringing the science and colors of the kaleidoscope to life. It is designed to be appropriate for K-8 but is promoted by the composer as an opera for "children young, and old."
