**OPERATION EDUCATION** is an innovative approach that presents standard curriculum through operatic performance. For the 2017-18 school year, we will be offering four different programs each designed for differing age groups.

## Little Miss Muffet Goes To The Opera <small>(3 years old - 2nd grade)</small>

This mini-opera is about a special day in the life of Little Miss Muffet. Through song, acting, dance, costumes and scenery, Miss Muffet meets someone who loves curds and whey as much as she does. Through Miss Muffet’s dilemma and choices, children will learn about the kindness and joy of sharing and making new friends.

## Beneath Suspicion <small>(5th grade and up)</small>

This work is the winner of the Opera Kansas Zepick Modern Opera competition. It is based on the lives of two bold 19th-century American women who crossed social, racial and economic barriers to work together, risking their lives to fight slavery. Elizabeth Van Lew and Mary Bowser gathered intelligence for the Union army. Mary, a former slave, went to work in the Jefferson Davis Confederate White House. There she used her gift, a photographic memory, to become one of the most effective spies for the Union. Her information was so reliable that her coded messages went directly to General Ulysses S. Grant. Both women were inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame in the 1990s. This opera would be an excellent enhancement to an American history class on the Civil War.

## The Telephone <small>(5th grade and up)</small>

This innovative adaptation of Menotti’s The Telephone shows how modern communication involving cell phones, texts and social media Tweets puts the path of true love in jeopardy.

# Opera Kansas on tour 

We are making plans to take opera on the road in the 2018-2019 seasons to cities across Kansas. As our new Managing Artistic Director settles into the new role this season, we will focus on two staged productions, school and senior living outreach and the open call for scores for the second Zepick Modern Opera Competition in the 2017-2018 season. 

The winner of the modern opera composition is used in schools and as a touring show. The winner, chosen in summer of 2018, will debut in the fall. The show will be produced in Wichita and taken on tour in the 2018-2019 season.
