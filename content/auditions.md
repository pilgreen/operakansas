# Auditions

Opera Kansas holds open auditions in Wichita, Kansas, every 12-18 months. Auditions are open to all singers of all ages and levels of experience as we cast a wide range of performers in our varied productions. Auditions develop a roster from which productions can be cast even several years in advance.

Please send a headshot, resume and video samples if available to Managing Artistic Director Ashley Winters.

All materials can be emailed to:

operakansas@gmail.com

If you have any questions, please contact us by e-mail at [operakansas@gmail.com](mailto:operakansas@gmail.com) or by phone at (785)393-1546.
