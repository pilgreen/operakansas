Opera Kansas holds open auditions in Wichita, Kansas, every 12-18 months. Auditions are open to all singers of all ages and levels of experience as we cast a wide range of performers in our varied productions. Auditions develop a roster from which productions can be cast even several years in advance.

Please send a headshot, resume and video samples if available to Managing Artistic Director Ashley Winters.
