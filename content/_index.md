# Opera Kansas announces the 2020 Zepick Modern Opera

In 2016, Opera Kansas, with the patronage of Dr. Lyle and Debi Zepick, created the Zepick Modern Opera Competition. This competition has yielded exciting new chamber operas in 2016 and 2018. Opera Kansas and the Zepicks believe that the next step for this program is to collaboratively create a work with a composer to be premiered in 2020. For composers desiring to be considered for this commission, requests for proposals are now being accepted through September 2, 2019.  Please click ZMOC 2020 button above for details and submission requirements.

### **Opera Kansas welcomes new President of the Board of Directors**

Opera Kansas begins 2019 with a new board president, J. Matthew Leavitt. Mr. Leavitt is excited to step into this new role with energy and determination to ensure the future of Opera Kansas. Matt has been a part of the Wichita art's community for decades. He has sung in several roles for Opera Kansas, most recently as the Page in _Amahl and the Night Visitors_ and is well lauded for his performances in the last several Wichita Bar Shows. Matt is an attorney in Wichita and is a partner at Hulnick, Stang, Gerring, and Leavitt, P.A. Opera Kansas looks forward to Mr. Leavitt's leadership.

Opera Kansas would also like to thank outgoing president, Virginia Revering. Her steady leadership and willingness to do whatever is needed leaves big shoes to fill. We are thankful that Virginia will remain on the board and we look forward to her next book that is scheduled to be published soon!

### **Opera Kansas is proud to announce the winner of the 2018 Zepick Modern Opera Competition**

Opera Kansas is proud to announce Anthony Green’s Mr. Brewster’s Invigorating Invention as the winner of the the Zepick Modern Opera Competition. The competition seeks short operas in English that have a STEAM theme (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics)  that can be used in the Kansas public school system. The Opera Kansas production will be the world premiere of this fascinating new opera that focuses on science and the composer behind the invention.

Mr. Brewster’s Invigorating Invention is about the history and science of the kaleidoscope. Sir David Brewster was a Scottish physicist who invented the kaleidoscope in 1816. Soon millions of kaleidoscopes were in homes across the world. He has been called, " the father of modern experimental optics." This production will use creative digital media in bringing the science and colors of the kaleidoscope to life.

The music of Anthony R. Green (b. 1984) ranges from works for solo instruments and voice to large scale ensemble pieces and multimedia productions. His works have been performed and featured in festivals in over 20 countries, as well as broadcast on national, international, and online streaming radio. An active pianist, Green has worked with student and professional composers alike for premieres or performances of new music. He has performed across the USA, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Cyprus, Israel, Germany, and South Korea.

When not composing or performing, Green is the associate artistic director of Castle of our Skins, a Boston-based concert and education series organization dedicated to celebrating Black artistry through music. He received a Bachelor of Music degree from Boston University, and a Master of Music degree from the New England Conservatory, and has been a resident artist at Escape to Create (Florida), the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts (Nebraska), the Visby International Centre for Composers (Sweden), Space/Time at Cove Park (Scotland), atelier:performance (Germany), and the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts (Nebraska).
