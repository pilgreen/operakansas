She also has extensive experience working in the technical and production fields of the music industry as a small business owner of a production company for ten years.

She believes the organization can provide an energetic home for new performances, in new productions, in new environments supported by classic repertoire that will provide memorable experiences for both performers and patrons. She is committed to continuing our tradition of outreach into schools, senior living facilities and the public at large while maintaining fiscal responsibility. 

Ashley received her Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance with Honors from the University of Kansas and a Bachelor of Music degree in Vocal Performance from the Wheaton College Conservatory of Music.
