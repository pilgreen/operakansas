# Opera Kansas Thanks You For A Landmark 30th Anniversary Season

Thank you for a fantastic 30th Anniversary season. We are proud to have been named the "most-improved" arts non-profit organization this year by the Wichita Arts Council. The committee cited Opera Kansas' efforts to provide consistently good programing and reach new audiences, including underserved populations.

Beginning in August 2015, we produced 59 performances, 25 in schools and 14 in senior living facilities. We took a number of productions on the road, bringing music to audiences across Kansas.

This April, we raised more than $9,500 during the Wichita Community Foundation's Art Day of Giving (ArtDOG) drive. This includes an additional $2,200 award, for coming in second in our fundraising category. 

Opera Kansas staged "Amahl and the Night Visitors" at Century II as well as "Operetta Under The Moon" at Chamber Music at The Barn in a show that had people laughing along with the beautiful music. We also hosted a modern opera competition where we debuted a staged opera, Beneath Suspicion, that brought rave reviews from both audiences and the composer. 

We thank you for your support over these 30 years and look forward to entertaining you for many more.
