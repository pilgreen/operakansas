Mr. Twister and the Tale of Tornado Alley, a brand new opera composed by Marc Hoffeditz, tells the tale of a family reunion between the North Wind and the South Wind as observed by a meteorologist and storm chaser, Mr. Twister, and his nephew. The story weaves together the science behind the formation of tornadoes and instruction on severe weather safety. Told via colorful characters, memorable melody, and approachable meteorological facts, this tale will appeal to a wide audience and maybe save a life or two. Opera Kansas is the winner of a Mid-America Arts Alliance Innovations Grant to bring the world premiere of this opera to the greater Wichita community. Opera Kansas is excited to partner with Exploration Place to bring to life this interactive and multi-sensory learning experience.

New and Updated Performance Dates and Times will be released soon!
