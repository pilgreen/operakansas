Originally produced by Roundabout Theater Company, New York City, in 1993

For two nights only, November 8 and 9, Opera Kansas will bring to the stage all your beloved R&H favorites. Taste and imagination, the two key ingredients for a first-rate revue, abound in this fresh take on the Rodgers & Hammerstein canon conceived by Tony Award winner Walter Bobbie. Over three decades after the duo's final collaboration, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, took the Great White Way by storm, it was in fact this new R&H musical that opened the 1994 Broadway season with flair and distinction, garnering wildly enthusiastic notices as well as earning two Tony nominations, including Best Musical. R&H probably never imagined 'Shall We Dance?' as a comic pas de deux for a towering beauty and her diminutive admirer, nor did they suspect that one day a lovelorn young lad might pose the musical question, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?' But that's precisely the kind of invention lavished upon this revue, with innovative musical arrangements including a sultry Andrews Sisters-esque 'I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair,' a swingin' 'Honeybun' worthy of the Modernaires, and a jazzy 'Kansas City' which leaves no question about how terrific the remarkable songs of R&H remain.

A GRAND NIGHT FOR SINGING is presented through special arrangement with R & H Theatricals:[ www.rnh.com.](http://www.rnh.com )
