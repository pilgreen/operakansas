For two nights only, November 8 and 9, Opera Kansas will bring to the stage all your beloved R&H favorites. Taste and imagination, abound in this fresh take on the Rodgers & Hammerstein canon conceived by Tony Award winner Walter Bobbie. Over three decades after the duo's final collaboration, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, took the Great White Way by storm, it was in fact this new R&H musical that opened the 1994 Broadway season with flair and distinction, garnering wildly enthusiastic notices as well as earning two Tony nominations, including Best Musical. R&H probably never imagined 'Shall We Dance?' as a comic pas de deux for a towering beauty and her diminutive admirer, nor did they suspect that one day a lovelorn young lad might pose the musical question, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?' But that's precisely the kind of invention lavished upon this revue, with innovative musical arrangements including a sultry Andrews Sisters-esque 'I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair,' a swingin' 'Honeybun' worthy of the Modernaires, and a jazzy 'Kansas City' which leaves no question about how terrific the remarkable songs of R&H remain.

A GRAND NIGHT FOR SINGING is presented through special arrangement with R & H Theatricals:[ www.rnh.com.](http://www.rnh.com )

You are cordially invited to celebrate with Opera Kansas

The 40th Birthday of dear Frederick.

February 29, 2020

7:00 PM

Crown Uptown Theatre

3207 E Douglas Avenue

Respondez S'il Vous Plait: Coming Soon

In 1880, Frederick discovered, much to his dismay, that his 21st birthday and his 21st year were not one and the same. But in 2020, we get to celebrate the momentous occasion of Fredrick's 40th birthday. Pour the pirate sherry and come P-arrgh-ty with Opera Kansas, Major Stanley, his daughters and of course the scalawag Pirate King and his rollicking band of scurvy dogs.

Mr. Twister and the Tale of Tornado Alley, a brand new opera composed by Marc Hoffeditz, tells the tale of a family reunion between the North Wind and the South Wind as observed by a meteorologist and storm chaser, Mr. Twister, and his nephew. The story weaves together the science behind the formation of tornadoes and instruction on severe weather safety. Told via colorful characters, memorable melody, and approachable meteorological facts, this tale will appeal to a wide audience and maybe save a life or two. Opera Kansas is the winner of a Mid-America Arts Alliance Innovations Grant to bring the world premiere of this opera to the greater Wichita community. Opera Kansas is excited to partner with Exploration Place and the National Weather Service Wichita to bring to life this interactive and multi-sensory learning experience.

Performance Dates and Times will be released soon!
